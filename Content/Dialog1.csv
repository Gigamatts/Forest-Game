Capy,Capy_Idle,Leaf! You're finally here! The forest is in chaos!
Leaf,Leaf_Idle,What happened?!
Capy,Capy_Idle,Dark magic has poisoned the Great Tree. Now monsters have appeared everywhere!
Capy,Capy_Idle,We need your help! 
Leaf,Leaf_Idle,"Don't worry pal, I am here to help! "
Capy,Capy_Idle,Oh really? Thank you!
Capy,Capy_Idle,All you need to find all magic gems to purify the Great Tree. I know there are some hidden in the forest.
Capy,Capy_Idle,Hop over to that tree trunk to get there!
Leaf,Leaf_Idle,Alright! Leaf Hopper to the rescue!
Leaf,Leaf_Idle,Guess there's no more nap time for me...
